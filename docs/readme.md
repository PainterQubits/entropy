# Entropy docs

Hi there, welcome! In this folder you can find documents explaining some of the basic functionality of Entropy.

You can start by going over the jupyter notebook `Intro.ipynb` where usage of the experiment graph authoring SDK is explained. 

The command line interface for starting Entropy projects is explained in `cli.md`

Some details on the HDF5 data persistance back end can be found on `hdf5.ipynb`
